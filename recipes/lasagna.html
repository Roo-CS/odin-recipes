    <div class="wrapped-text">
      <p>&emsp;Lasagna is a classic Italian dish renowned for its hearty, comforting layers of flavors and textures. This beloved dish is made by alternating thin sheets of pasta with rich fillings, such as a savory meat sauce, creamy ricotta or b√©chamel, and melted cheese. Each layer is infused with the robust flavors of herbs like basil and oregano, creating a balanced blend of tangy tomato, tender pasta, and luscious cheese. While traditionally baked in the oven until golden and bubbling, variations of lasagna can include vegetarian options, seafood, or even innovative twists like zucchini slices in place of pasta.</p>
      <p>&emsp;Beyond its delicious taste, lasagna is a symbol of family gatherings and celebrations. It is often prepared as a centerpiece for holidays or special occasions, bringing people together over its comforting warmth. Lasagna's versatility allows for endless customization, making it a dish that adapts to regional flavors and personal preferences. Whether enjoyed as leftovers or fresh out of the oven, lasagna remains a timeless favorite that satisfies both the palate and the soul.</p>
